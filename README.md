Energy Consumption Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict energy consumption based on historical data using Linear Regression. The model helps in analyzing patterns, forecasting future energy demand, and optimizing resource allocation.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains historical energy usage data, including factors such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Time of day

Power consumption (target variable)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and scale numerical features.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and trends

Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features

Model Training: Applying Linear Regression to predict energy consumption

Evaluation: Measuring model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualization: Displaying results with graphs and heatmaps

🔍 Key Findings

Identified the most significant factors affecting energy consumption.

Developed a regression model with an R² score of XX%, showing strong predictive power.

Visualized insights that can help optimize energy usage.
